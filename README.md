# web-scraping-challenge
Exercise utilizing Python, BeautifulSoup, Pandas, MongoDB, Flask, Splinter and HTML

In this excersize I scraped multiple websites utlizing BeatifulSoup and Splinter.  
A MongoDB Database was created with the results and a webserver was built using Flask running a python script
to render a webpage via HTML.

Pressing the Scrape button on the webpage will query/ Requery for fresh data.

Example of webserver results:
